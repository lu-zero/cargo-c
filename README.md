[cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo) applet to build and install C-ABI compatible dynamic and static libraries.

It produces and installs a correct [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) file, a static library and a dynamic library, and a C header to be used by any C (and C-compatible) software.

## Installation
**cargo-c** may be installed from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-c).
``` sh
cargo install cargo-c
```

You must have the **cargo** build [requirements](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#compiling-from-source) satisfied in order to build **cargo-c**:
* `git`
* `pkg-config` (on Unix, used to figure out the host-provided headers/libraries)
* `curl` (on Unix)
* OpenSSL headers (only for Unix, this is the `libssl-dev` package on deb-based distributions)

You may pass `--features=vendored-openssl` if you have problems building openssl-sys using the host-provided OpenSSL.

``` sh
cargo install cargo-c --features=vendored-openssl
```

## Usage
``` sh
# build the library, create the .h header, create the .pc file
$ cargo cbuild --destdir=${D} --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64
```
``` sh
# build the library, create the .h header, create the .pc file, build and run the tests
$ cargo ctest
```
``` sh
# build the library, create the .h header, create the .pc file and install all of it
$ cargo cinstall --destdir=${D} --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64
```

For a more in-depth explanation of how `cargo-c` works and how to use it for
your crates, read [Building Crates so they Look Like C ABI Libraries][dev.to].

### The TL;DR:

- [Create][diff-1] a `capi.rs` with the C-API you want to expose and use
  ~~`#[cfg(cargo_c)]`~~`#[cfg(feature="capi")]` to hide it when you build a normal rust library.
- [Make sure][diff-2] you have a lib target and if you are using a workspace
  the first member is the crate you want to export, that means that you might
  have [to add a "." member at the start of the list][diff-3].
- ~~Since Rust 1.38, also add "staticlib" to the "lib" `crate-type`.~~ Do not specify the `crate-type`, cargo-c will add the correct library target by itself.
- You may use the feature `capi` to add C-API-specific optional dependencies.
  > **NOTE**: It must be always present in `Cargo.toml`
- Remember to [add][diff-4] a [`cbindgen.toml`][cbindgen-toml] and fill it with
  at least the include guard and probably you want to set the language to C (it
  defaults to C++)
- Once you are happy with the result update your documentation to tell the user
  to install `cargo-c` and do `cargo cinstall --prefix=/usr
  --destdir=/tmp/some-place` or something along those lines.

## Advanced
You may override various aspects of `cargo-c` via settings in `Cargo.toml` under the `package.metadata.capi` key

```toml
[package.metadata.capi]
# Configures the minimum required cargo-c version. Trying to run with an
# older version causes an error.
min_version = "0.6.10"
```

### Header Generation

```toml
[package.metadata.capi.header]
# Used as header file name. By default this is equal to the crate name.
# The name can be with or without the header filename extension `.h`
name = "new_name"
# Install the header into a subdirectory with the name of the crate. This
# is enabled by default, pass `false` or "" to disable it.
subdirectory = "libfoo-2.0/foo"
# Generate the header file with `cbindgen`, or copy a pre-generated header
# from the `assets` subdirectory. By default a header is generated.
generation = true
# Can be use to disable header generation completely.
# This can be used when generating dynamic modules instead of an actual library.
enabled = true
```

### `pkg-config` File Generation

```toml
[package.metadata.capi.pkg_config]
# Used as the package name in the pkg-config file and defaults to the crate name.
name = "libfoo"
# Used as the pkg-config file name and defaults to the crate name.
filename = "libfoo-2.0"
# Used as the package description in the pkg-config file and defaults to the crate description.
description = "some description"
# Used as the package version in the pkg-config file and defaults to the crate version.
version = "1.2.3"
# Used as the Requires field in the pkg-config file, if defined
requires = "gstreamer-1.0, gstreamer-base-1.0"
# Used as the Requires.private field in the pkg-config file, if defined
requires_private = "gobject-2.0, glib-2.0 >= 2.56.0, gmodule-2.0"
# Strip the include search path from the last n components, useful to support installing in a
# subdirectory but then include with the path. By default it is 0.
strip_include_path_components = 1

```

### Library Generation

```toml
[package.metadata.capi.library]
# Used as the library name and defaults to the crate name. This might get
# prefixed with `lib` depending on the target platform.
name = "new_name"
# Used as library version and defaults to the crate version. How this is used
# depends on the target platform.
version = "1.2.3"
# Used to install the library to a subdirectory of `libdir`.
install_subdir = "gstreamer-1.0"
# Used to disable versioning links when installing the dynamic library
versioning = false
# Add `-Cpanic=abort` to the RUSTFLAGS automatically, it may be useful in case
# something might panic in the crates used by the library.
rustflags = "-Cpanic=abort"
```

### Custom data install
```toml
[package.metadata.capi.install.data]
# Used to install the data to a subdirectory of `datadir`. By default it is the same as `name`
subdirectory = "foodata"
# Copy the pre-generated data files found in {root_dir}/{from} to {datadir}/{to}/{matched subdirs}
# If {from} is a single path instead of a glob, the destination is {datapath}/{to}.
# datapath is {datadir}/{subdirectory}
assets = [{from="pattern/with/or/without/**/*", to="destination"}]
# Copy the pre-generated data files found in {OUT_DIR}/{from} to {includedir}/{to}/{matched subdirs}
# If {from} is a single path instead of a glob, the destination is {datapath}/{to}.
# datapath is {datadir}/{subdirectory}
generated = [{from="pattern/with/or/without/**/*", to="destination"]

[package.metadata.capi.install.include]
# Copy the pre-generated includes found in {root_dir}/{from} to {includedir}/{to}/{matched subdirs}
# If {from} is a single path instead of a glob, the destination is {includepath}/{to}.
# includepath is {includedir}/{header.subdirectory}
assets = [{from="pattern/with/or/without/**/*", to="destination"}]
# Copy the pre-generated includes found in {OUT_DIR}/{from} to {includedir}/{to}/{matched subdirs}
# If {from} is a single path instead of a glob, the destination is {includedpath}/{to}.
# includepath is {includedir}/{header.subdirectory}
generated = [{from="pattern/with/or/without/**/*", to="destination"]
```

### Notes

Do **not** pass `RUSTFLAGS` that are managed by cargo through other means, (e.g. the flags driven by `[profiles]` or the flags driven by `[target.<>]`), cargo-c effectively builds as if the *target* is always explicitly passed.
